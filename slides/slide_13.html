<h4>how it works (roughly)</h4>
<p class="small">
  Accelerometers are usually made of piezoelectric materials (quartz crystals).</p>
<p class="small">
  The acceleration loads the piezoelectric element according to Newton's second law of motion (F=ma).</>
  <p class="small">
  That force can be observed in the change in the electrostatic force or voltage generated by the crystal.
