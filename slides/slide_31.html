<div id="s_31">
    <h4>measurements</h4>
  <p>
    in terms of visualization, <span class="hightlighted">orientation</span> is easier to visualize
    since numbers are within a range
  </p>
  <p>
<span class="hightlighted">acceleration/motion</span> numbers are more arbitrary and sometimes less accurate
  </p>
