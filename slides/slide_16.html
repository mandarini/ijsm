<h4>how it works</h4>
<p class="small">
   microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) gyroscopes, which are vibrating structure gyroscopes.
</p>
<p class="small">
  a vibrating object tends to continue vibrating in the same plane even if its support rotates.
  The Coriolis effect causes the object to exert a force on its support.
  by measuring this force the rate of rotation can be determined.
  </p>
  <p class="small">
    When rotating, the orientation of this axis is unaffected by tilting
    or rotation of the mounting, according to the <span class="highlighted">conservation of angular momentum.</span>
